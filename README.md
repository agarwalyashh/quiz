# React Quiz Practise Project

This project consists of 15 questions based on React concepts which were uploaded in a json file and then fetched using a fake-api server created by npm json-server package and then 
fetched using useEffect hook in React.
Using the concepts of useReducer hook, this project dealt with managing different states required for the proper functioning of the App.

The app was broken down into several Components, which form the building blocks of React. The entire styling in the application was done using Tailwind CSS.
